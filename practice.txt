Let's try some more practice. I'm writing some notes in this notepad file as though I were writing documentation for a recent project. 

I'll continue to type because typing is fun, and I type much faster now than I did twenty years ago. I think. Oh no, I suddenly realized that I am getting old.

What happens if I edit this before I add it?
